# Flight Route System

This repository contains a C++ program to simulate a flight route system. The system allows users to find the shortest path between two cities based on cost and display all possible routes between the cities using Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Features

- **Add Routes:** Add flight routes between cities with associated costs.
- **Find Shortest Path:** Compute the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Display All Routes:** List all possible routes between two cities.

## Cities Included

The system includes the following cities and their connections:
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Pune, Coimbatore.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++
- Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search (DFS)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitksr/Flight-Route-Management-System.git
   cd Flight-Route-Management-System
2. Compile the program:
    ```bash
   g++ -o flight_routes Main.cpp
3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
   ./flight_routes
  ## Usage

1. **Run the program** by compiling the `Main.cpp` file.
2. **Input the starting and destination cities** as prompted by the program.
3. **Select an option** from the menu:
   - **Find Shortest Path:** Displays the shortest path and its cost between the two cities.
   - **Display All Routes:** Lists all possible routes between the two cities.
     
## Code Overview

### `FlightRoutes` Class

  The program uses the `FlightRoutes` class to manage a graph of cities and 
  their connections. Below are the details of its components:

#### 1. Graph Representation:

  ##### - A map<string, vector<pair<string, int>>> is used to represent the 
  graph, 
  where:
   - Key: City name (case-insensitive).
   - Value: A list of pairs, each containing a connected city and the cost 
     of travel.
#### 2. Key Functions:

  - addRoute: Adds a bi-directional route between two cities with a 
    specified cost.
  - findShortestPath: Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the 
    shortest path and cost between two cities.
  - displayRoutes: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find and display all 
    possible routes between two cities.
#### 3. Error Handling:
 
  - Detects invalid city names and displays appropriate error messages.
     Handles cases where no routes are available.
 ### Algorithms Used
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Efficiently calculates the shortest path in a 
     weighted graph.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores all possible routes between two 
    cities recursively.


## Example Interaction

Below is an example of interaction with the program:
